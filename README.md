# Primitive-Chess
This is a simpler version of chess made in Java as a midterm project.

The game is lacking the following functionalities compared to real chess:
➢ End game control : you can end the game when no pieces exist from one color, in real version the game ends when the king is in checkmate
➢ Promote: You can assume at the last row Pawn only becomes a Queen .
➢ Absolute pin: a piece can be played even it would put the King into check
➢ Check control: you can assume Kings can be captured as normal pieces.
➢ The En Passant rule: after a Pawn moves two squares from its starting square, and it could have been captured by an enemy Pawn had it advanced only one square.
➢ Pawn is only promoted to Queen

The game is played by writing the coordinates of pieces into the console. The game ends when no pieces exist from one color.
